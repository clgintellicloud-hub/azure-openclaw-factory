# Azure OpenClaw Factory

Staged deployment of OpenClaw AI agents to Azure Container Apps via GitHub Actions CI/CD.

This repository builds agent-specific Docker images, pushes them to Azure Container Registry (ACR), deploys them to Azure Container Apps, enables A2A inter-app communication between agents, validates dev with smoke tests, and promotes the same image tag to prod after approval.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub admin access to `clg-built4tech-azure/azure-openclaw-factory`
- Azure subscription access with permission to create resource groups, ACR, Container Apps, Log Analytics, and role assignments
- An Entra ID app registration for GitHub Actions OIDC
- Azure CLI for local setup tasks
- Docker Desktop for local image testing

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets

Set these in **Repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions**:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Entra ID app client ID (for OIDC) |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure subscription ID |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Shared token required by the OpenClaw Gateway in Azure |

Generate `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` with a strong random value. Do not commit it to this repo.

### Step 2: Configure Federated Identity

In your Entra ID app registration, add a federated credential:
- **Issuer**: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- **Subject**: `repo:clg-built4tech-azure/azure-openclaw-factory:ref:refs/heads/main`
- **Audience**: `api://AzureADTokenExchange`

The same Entra ID app must have enough Azure permissions to run the infrastructure and deployment workflows.

### Step 3: Provision Infrastructure

Go to **Actions -> openclaw-infra -> Run workflow** with:
- **location**: Azure region (default: `eastus`)
- **acr_sku**: ACR SKU (default: `Basic`)
- **service_principal_object_id**: Your SP object ID (get via `az ad sp show --id <clientId> --query id`)
- **openclaw_container_app_count**: Number of generic OpenClaw Container Apps to create per environment (default: `0`)

This deploys:
- Resource groups (`rg-openclaw-dev`, `rg-openclaw-prod`)
- ACR (`ocrocagentdev`)
- Container Apps environments
- Container Apps (hermes-dev, analyst-dev, hermes-prod, analyst-prod)
- Optional generic OpenClaw Container Apps (`openclaw-1-dev`, `openclaw-2-dev`, `openclaw-1-prod`, and so on)
- Log Analytics workspace
- All RBAC role assignments

### Step 4: Deploy Agents

Push to `main` or run the `openclaw-deploy` workflow manually. The flow is:

1. **Build** -> installs OpenClaw in each Docker image and pushes the image to ACR
2. **Deploy Dev** -> updates dev Container Apps to pull the new ACR images
3. **Validate Dev** -> checks each app's `/health` endpoint
4. **Approve** -> manual approval for prod (configure in GitHub Environments)
5. **Deploy Prod** -> promotes the same image tag to prod

Each agent image starts `openclaw gateway run` on internal port `19001` and exposes a small HTTP health endpoint on port `8080` for Azure Container Apps. The deployment stores `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` as a Container App secret and passes it to OpenClaw at runtime.

## Inter-App Communication / A2A

Each Container App now exposes A2A-compatible HTTP endpoints from the shared launcher in `agents/common/src/agent.js`:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` | Public discovery document with agent metadata, skills, auth, and message endpoint |
| `POST /message:send` | Authenticated A2A message send endpoint |
| `POST /message:stream` | Authenticated A2A Server-Sent Events stream for task state updates |
| `POST /a2a` | Authenticated JSON-RPC compatibility endpoint for `message/send`, `tasks/get`, and `tasks/cancel` |
| `GET /tasks` | Authenticated in-memory task list |
| `GET /tasks/<id>` | Authenticated task lookup |
| `GET /tasks/<id>/events` | Authenticated Server-Sent Events subscription for task updates |
| `POST /tasks/<id>/cancel` | Authenticated task cancellation |
| `GET /a2a/peers` | Authenticated view of configured peer agents |

The deployment enables Dapr on every Container App and uses Dapr service invocation for app-to-app calls inside the same Container Apps environment. JSON-RPC remains available at `/a2a`; Dapr is only the Azure-internal transport between Container Apps. The `A2A_PEER_NAMES` environment variable is generated during deployment from the fixed agents plus the configured generic OpenClaw app count.

Authenticated A2A calls use the `A2A_SHARED_TOKEN` environment variable. The workflow sets it from the existing `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret, so no additional secret is committed or required by default.

Example local A2A request:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:18080/.well-known/agent-card.json

curl -s http://localhost:18080/message:send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer local-test-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":{"role":"user","parts":[{"kind":"text","text":"hello"}]}}'

curl -N http://localhost:18080/message:stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer local-test-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":{"role":"user","parts":[{"kind":"text","text":"stream hello"}]}}'
```

When deploying generic OpenClaw apps, use the same `openclaw_container_app_count` value that was used by the infrastructure workflow so the deploy workflow updates every numbered app that exists.

### Step 5: Configure Prod Environment Protection

In **Repository Settings -> Environments -> prod**, add required reviewers.

## Local Validation

Build the images locally:

```bash
docker build -f agents/hermes/Dockerfile -t azure-openclaw-hermes:test .
docker build -f agents/analyst/Dockerfile -t azure-openclaw-analyst:test .
docker build -f agents/openclaw/Dockerfile -t azure-openclaw-openclaw:test .
```

Run a local smoke test:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 18080:8080 -e OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=local-test-token azure-openclaw-hermes:test
curl http://localhost:18080/health
```

The health endpoint should return HTTP `200` with a JSON status payload.

## Generic OpenClaw App Count

The `openclawContainerAppCount` Bicep parameter controls how many generic OpenClaw Container Apps are created in each environment.

| Count | Dev apps | Prod apps |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | none | none |
| `1` | `openclaw-1-dev` | `openclaw-1-prod` |
| `3` | `openclaw-1-dev`, `openclaw-2-dev`, `openclaw-3-dev` | `openclaw-1-prod`, `openclaw-2-prod`, `openclaw-3-prod` |

The workflow input is named `openclaw_container_app_count`. Keep the infra and deploy workflow values aligned.

## Security

This is a public repository. Do not commit secrets, credentials, private keys, `.env` files, generated Azure credential files, or local settings. Use GitHub Actions secrets and Azure Container App secrets for runtime values.

The repo includes `.gitignore` rules for common local secret files and generated infrastructure outputs.

## Architecture Separation

| Concern | Location | Deployed By |
|---|---|---|
| **Services** (ACR, ACA, RGs) | `infra/bicep/` | `openclaw-infra` workflow |
| **IAM/RBAC** | `infra/iam/` | `openclaw-infra` workflow |
| **Application** (agents, images) | `agents/`, `.github/workflows/` | `openclaw-deploy` workflow |

## Rollback

```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh <agent-name> <env> <image-tag>
# Example:
./scripts/rollback.sh hermes prod oc-abc1234def
```

By default rollback uses the shared ACR name `ocrocagentdev`. Override it with `ACR_NAME` if you provisioned a different registry name.

For numbered generic OpenClaw apps, pass the app base name and environment:

```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh openclaw-1 dev oc-abc1234def
```

The rollback script maps `openclaw-1`, `openclaw-2`, and other numbered OpenClaw apps back to the shared `openclaw` image repository.

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/<name>/` with `Dockerfile`, `src/`, `config/`
2. Add the agent name to the `agentNames` parameter in `infra/bicep/main.bicep`
3. Add the agent name to the matrix in `openclaw-deploy.yml`
4. Run the `openclaw-infra` workflow to create the new Container App
5. Deploy via the `openclaw-deploy` workflow

For generic OpenClaw capacity, prefer increasing `openclaw_container_app_count` instead of adding named agents.
